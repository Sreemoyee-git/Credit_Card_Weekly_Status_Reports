# Credit_Card_Weekly_Status_Reports

Problem Statement:

As part of this task, It is required to build two
interactive Power BI dashboards from the provided
datasets. The dashboards should provide actionable
insights and be filtered by gender (Male/Female). The
primary focus is to create meaningful visualizations
based on key metrics related to Credit Card
Customers and Credit Card Transactions.

What I Did:

1. Customer Data Analysis:

Analyzed the demographic breakdown of customers, including job roles, education level, marital status, and income range.

Generated reports on customer satisfaction, focusing on factors like the customer’s job, education level, and dependent count, correlated with income range.

Visualized the distribution of credit card usage across various customer segments.

2. Transaction Data Analysis:

Aggregated transaction data over several months to observe trends in spending and transaction volumes.

Identified transaction behaviors, such as the use of credit cards via chip, swipe, or online methods, and compared these patterns to transaction trends over time.

Calculated key metrics such as the total transaction amount, average spending, utilization ratios, and trends in various spending categories like bills, entertainment, and fuel.

3. Trend Analysis:

Created monthly transaction trend visuals to track spending growth, interest earned, and transactional volume.

Analyzed the impact of payment methods on transaction amounts and frequency, including comparisons between customers using the chip and those using swipe/online transactions.

Developed dashboards to monitor average utilization ratios against target values and customer delinquency status.


Tools Used:

Power BI: Used to develop interactive dashboards and visualizations for both customer and transaction data. Power BI was used for querying, aggregating, and creating dynamic visual reports, leveraging its drag-and-drop interface and filtering capabilities.

Data Modeling: Utilized for structuring data relationships between various fields (e.g., customer demographics, transaction types, and spending categories) to facilitate deeper analysis.

1. Recommendations:

Targeted Marketing: Focus on high-spending categories such as bills, entertainment, and fuel to develop customized offers for customers. Consider creating loyalty programs targeted at frequent users of specific categories.

Customer Segmentation: Use customer satisfaction scores, job roles, and education levels to further segment the customer base. This could help in targeting specific offers for high-income professionals or retirees who may be high-spending customers.

Optimize Payment Method Usage: Since a significant portion of transactions is done through chip transactions, marketing campaigns could encourage increased chip usage for added security benefits, especially in online transactions.

Delinquency Monitoring: Regularly track delinquency trends and identify segments with higher delinquency rates, tailoring interventions such as reminders or limit adjustments to reduce risks.

2. Conclusion:

The analysis provides a comprehensive view of how customers interact with credit card products and their spending behavior. This report can help the financial institution optimize its offerings, manage risk more effectively, and focus on growth areas.
By continuously monitoring key metrics like average spending, transaction volumes, and customer satisfaction, businesses can adjust their strategies to ensure customer satisfaction and drive increased revenue.
